    <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Dihydrogen Monoxide</strong>, also known as <em>hydroxylacid</em> or <em>DHMO</em><sup>1</sup>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup>:
        <br> is the major component of acid rain,
        <br> contributes to the greenhouse effect,
        <br> may cause severe burns,
        <br> is fatal if inhaled,
        <br> contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,
        <br> accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals,
        <br> may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes,
        <br> and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients. Despite the danger, DHMO is often used:
    </p>
    <p>
        as an industrial solvent and coolant in nuclear power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,
        <br> as a fire retardant,
        <br> in many forms of cruel animal research,
        <br> as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products,
        <br> in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
